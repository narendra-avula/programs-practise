The very first step of getting started with online judge is to understand:

How to read input data?
How to output the answer?
At HackerEarth, input data is read from standard input stream (STDIN) and results are printed to standard output stream (STDOUT).

Most of the questions will deal with either integers or strings.

An example C code to read an integer from STDIN and printing it out to STDOUT is shown below.

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int n;
    scanf("%d",&n); //read input integer from STDIN
    printf("%d",n); //print output integer to STDOUT
    return 0;
}
Sample code snippet to read integer for all other languages are given in the code editor below.

An example C code to read a string from STDIN and printing it out to STDOUT.

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    char a[100]; //assuming that string size will not exceed 100
    scanf("%s",a); //read a string in array a
    printf("%s",a); //print out array a
    return 0;
}
Careful not to print any thing else in the output, such as printf("The answer is %d",n); because the online

judge directly compares your output to expected output like normal string comparison.

Say if expected output is 5, and the code prints The answer is 5 then when online judge compares 5 with The answer is 5,

it will say that the code produced wrong result. Every HackerEarth problem has a predefined input and output format.

Every problem will also have Constraints section which helps in determining what size of array to be created or what

datatypes to use, say int or long long.

The below exercise would be a great start. Welcome to the world of Competitive Programming.
