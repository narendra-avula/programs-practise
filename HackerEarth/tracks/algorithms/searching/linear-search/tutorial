Linear Search is generally used on a collections of items. It relies on the technique of traversing a list from start

to end exploring properties of all elements found on the way.

For example, consider an array of integers of size

N. Now it is required to find and print the position of all the elements with value

x. Here, linear search is simply based on the idea of matching each element from the start to the end of the list with

the integer

x, and then printing the position of the element if the condition is `True'.

The pseudo code for the above example is as follows :

for(start to end of array)
{
    if (current_element equals to 5)
    {
        print (current_index);
    }
}
For example, consider the following image:

enter image description here

Consider one wants of find all the positions of the occurrence of number

7 in this array. For this, every element in the array from start to end, that is from index

1 to index

10 shall be visited once and compared with number

7, in order to check whether a match is found or not.

The Time Complexity of Linear Search is

O(N) as we visit each element of the array exactly once.
