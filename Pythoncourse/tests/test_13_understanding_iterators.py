Iterators are objects that represent a stream of data. next() method on an iterator returns
the next available element. StopIteration is raised when elements are finished.

Python builtins like sequences (strings, lists, tuples), sets and dicts are iterable (ie) you can call iter(obj) on them
and get an iterator object on their data.

Iterators allows us to write functions and implement language features which can
work with any iterable instead of having specialized implementation for each of
list, tuple, string etc.
