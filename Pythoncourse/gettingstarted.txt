We are going to learn python using hands on coding in this course.

0. Unzip the pythoncourse.zip into your work folder. For e.g. c:\work, then you will have the folder in 
   c:\work\pythoncourse. DONT unzip to c:\work\pythoncourse or you will end with a pythoncourse folder
   under pythoncourse like c:\work\pythoncourse\pythoncourse\
  
   Open this in pycharm:
   File -> Open... and select c:\work\pythoncourse
   Open Directory -> and select c:\work\pythoncourse in the initial screen.

1. Each python concept is exposed as a module(file) of the form test_XX_concept.py

2. Each module has a set of test functions which will fail by default.

3. If you have already configured py.test, you should be able right click each file and run it with pytest

4. See lessonworkflow.png in your browser like chrome to see the common flow you will follow for each lesson.

5. You are advised and encouraged to use the python interpreter (Alt + P) to figure things out. Second option is to
   use google or post to pizza for help or discussion.

6. Once you are done with a module, you have to fill 2 variables in each module. I will be writing scripts later on to
   extract this info for summary and analysis.

   -three_things_i_learnt: the "THREE MOST IMPORTANT" that "YOU" have learnt in the module. There are no right and
    wrong answers here. These are things that you consider important. write in the triple quoted string one per line after
    the -.
   -time_taken_minutes : how long did u take to complete this module including filling the above variable. This will
    help me size the modules, the weekly schedule etc. THIS SHOULD BE A SIMPLE NUMBER IN MINUTES  e.g 30, 10, 20 etc. 
    Dont write in english like 30min or 0.5hr etc.

7. Once you are done with the module, upload it to DROPBOX. You should share a folder ol2013-<college>-<yourname> with mrnd@outlook.com
   and under it create a subdirectory called pythoncourse. So after you submit files it will look like 
   ol2013-<college>-<yourname>\pythoncourse\test_00_understanding_assert.py. For e.g if you are from gitam and your name is vishnu, the folder will be called ol2013-gitam-vishnu\pythoncourse\ and you will put your lessons in that folder after completing.
